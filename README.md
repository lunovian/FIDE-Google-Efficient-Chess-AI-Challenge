# Chess Bot Project

Welcome to the Chess Bot Project! This project aims to develop a competitive chess bot, evolving through various stages of complexity. The bot will leverage game rules, heuristic evaluation, and advanced algorithms to play chess intelligently.

---

## Features

- **Legal Moves Generation**: Ensures all moves follow chess rules.
- **Basic Prioritization**: Captures high-value pieces, prioritizes checkmates, and promotes pawns.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Implements Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning for strategic planning.
- **Custom Heuristics**: Evaluates moves based on material, positional advantage, and king safety.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses reinforcement learning and neural networks for advanced decision-making.

## Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Basic Chess Bot**

- [ ] **Set Up Environment**:
  - [ ] Learn chess rules and UCI/FEN notations.
  - [ ] Install `python-chess` or `Chessnut` library.
- [ ] **Basic Move Prioritization**:
  - [ ] Prioritize checkmates, captures, and queen promotions.
  - [ ] Add a fallback for random moves.

#### Deliverables:

- [ ] A bot that can play legal moves and prioritize simple strategies.

---

### **Phase 2: Intermediate Chess Bot**

- [ ] **Implement Heuristics**:
  - [ ] Add scoring metrics for material, position, and king safety.
- [ ] **Use Minimax Algorithm**:
  - [ ] Evaluate moves for both the bot and opponent.
  - [ ] Implement Alpha-Beta pruning to optimize decision-making.

#### Deliverables:

- [ ] A bot capable of planning moves 2-3 steps ahead with basic heuristics.

---

### **Phase 3: Advanced Chess Bot**

- [ ] **Opening Knowledge**:
  - [ ] Integrate a chess opening book.
- [ ] **Endgame Strategies**:
  - [ ] Add knowledge of specific endgame principles.
- [ ] **Optimization**:
  - [ ] Implement transposition tables for caching board evaluations.
  - [ ] Use parallel processing for faster move evaluation.

#### Deliverables:

- [ ] A bot that performs well in opening, midgame, and endgame.

---

### **Phase 4: Competitive Chess Bot**

- [ ] **Integrate Machine Learning**:
  - [ ] Train a reinforcement learning agent using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).
  - [ ] Leverage pre-trained neural networks for board evaluation.
- [ ] **Fine-Tune Performance**:
  - [ ] Use self-play to identify weaknesses and improve strategies.
- [ ] **Test Against Other Bots**:
  - [ ] Benchmark the botâ€™s performance against Stockfish or other bots.

#### Deliverables:

- [ ] A competitive bot ready for challenges or tournaments.

---

### **Phase 5: Master Chess Bot**

- [ ] **Advanced Features**:
  - [ ] Add time management strategies for blitz games.
  - [ ] Implement multi-level difficulty.
- [ ] **Deployment**:
  - [ ] Package the bot as an API or standalone application.
  - [ ] Provide a user-friendly interface for human players.

#### Deliverables:

- [ ] A fully-featured chess bot ready for deployment or competition.
