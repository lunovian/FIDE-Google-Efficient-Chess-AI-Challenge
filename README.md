# Chess Bot Project

Welcome to the Chess Bot Project! This project aims to develop a competitive chess bot, evolving through various stages of complexity. The bot will leverage game rules, heuristic evaluation, and advanced algorithms to play chess intelligently.

---

## Features
- **Legal Moves Generation**: Ensures all moves follow chess rules.
- **Basic Prioritization**: Captures high-value pieces, prioritizes checkmates, and promotes pawns.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Implements Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning for strategic planning.
- **Custom Heuristics**: Evaluates moves based on material, positional advantage, and king safety.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses reinforcement learning and neural networks for advanced decision-making.

## Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Basic Chess Bot**
1. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Learn chess rules and UCI/FEN notations.
   - Install `python-chess` or `Chessnut` library.
2. **Basic Move Prioritization**:
   - Prioritize checkmates, captures, and queen promotions.
   - Add a fallback for random moves.

#### Deliverables:
- A bot that can play legal moves and prioritize simple strategies.

---

### **Phase 2: Intermediate Chess Bot**
3. **Implement Heuristics**:
   - Add scoring metrics for material, position, and king safety.
4. **Use Minimax Algorithm**:
   - Evaluate moves for both the bot and opponent.
   - Implement Alpha-Beta pruning to optimize decision-making.

#### Deliverables:
- A bot capable of planning moves 2-3 steps ahead with basic heuristics.

---

### **Phase 3: Advanced Chess Bot**
5. **Opening Knowledge**:
   - Integrate a chess opening book.
6. **Endgame Strategies**:
   - Add knowledge of specific endgame principles.
7. **Optimization**:
   - Implement transposition tables for caching board evaluations.
   - Use parallel processing for faster move evaluation.

#### Deliverables:
- A bot that performs well in opening, midgame, and endgame.

---

### **Phase 4: Competitive Chess Bot**
8. **Integrate Machine Learning**:
   - Train a reinforcement learning agent using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).
   - Leverage pre-trained neural networks for board evaluation.
9. **Fine-Tune Performance**:
   - Use self-play to identify weaknesses and improve strategies.
10. **Test Against Other Bots**:
    - Benchmark the bot’s performance against Stockfish or other bots.

#### Deliverables:
- A competitive bot ready for challenges or tournaments.

---

### **Phase 5: Master Chess Bot**
11. **Advanced Features**:
    - Add time management strategies for blitz games.
    - Implement multi-level difficulty.
12. **Deployment**:
    - Package the bot as an API or standalone application.
    - Provide a user-friendly interface for human players.

#### Deliverables:
- A fully-featured chess bot ready for deployment or competition.
