# Chess Bot Project

Welcome to the Chess Bot Project! This project aims to develop a competitive chess bot, evolving through various stages of complexity. The bot will leverage game rules, heuristic evaluation, and advanced algorithms to play chess intelligently.

## Features

- **Legal Moves Generation**: Ensures all moves follow chess rules.
- **Basic Prioritization**: Captures high-value pieces, prioritizes checkmates, and promotes pawns.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Implements Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning for strategic planning.
- **Custom Heuristics**: Evaluates moves based on material, positional advantage, and king safety.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses reinforcement learning and neural networks for advanced decision-making.
